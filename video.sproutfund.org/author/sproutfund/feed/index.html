		<description><![CDATA[Diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at 41-years-old, local artist and writer David Matthews explores his own life and struggles with relationships in Julie Sokolow’s full-length documentary.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Matthews can’t get a date. He is a writer and artist with a great sense of humor and impeccable dry delivery. He has scored solo art shows around Pittsburgh, readings at coffee shops, and acting gigs in a few short films. He’s got a nice job, house, and car, and could even treat a lady to dinner. So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>At 41 years of age, David was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. This late-in-life diagnosis and lack of treatment in childhood has left David with a lot of catching up to do. Although David is highly intelligent, he has a major blind spot: empathy and understanding of the human, especially female, psyche.</p>
<p>Aspie Seeks Love follows David’s journey to understand his Asperger’s, improve as a person, writer, and artist, and find a meaningful relationship. We’ll watch David explore the Pittsburgh autism community for the first time and compare notes with fellow “Aspies”. We’ll also watch David explore the world of OKCupid online dating and attempt to break out of his shell to form relationships in person. David’s quest will culminate in the Pittsburgh release party for his very first book, Meltdown in the Cereal Aisle.</p>
<p>I am inspired by characters with singular voices. Through documentary filmmaking, I hope to amplify the understated, overlooked, and disenfranchised perspectives often found on the periphery of the mainstream. I am particularly fascinated by creative people who express their visions and experiences constructively, through art.</p>
<p>My most longstanding passion has been at the intersection of creativity and mental health. In Aspie Seeks Love, David Matthews uses writing and art to cope with and express the symptoms of his autism. Our film specifically celebrates the therapeutic power of creativity and various communities existing around literature and the arts.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Amy Conaway’s documentary spotlights the eating habits of young children while highlighting the work of several Pittsburgh food non-profits, inspiring our community to educate itself about cooking.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proposed is a 45-minute documentary film spotlighting eating habits in young children and highlighting the work of several Pittsburgh non-profits related to food. Its purpose is to reduce anxiety surrounding feeding toddlers, promote a culture of reverence for the table in families, and inspire society to educate children about cooking and encourage these ideals in the children they love. The film features statistics about positive peer pressure as it influences food choice, case studies of families who are effectively incorporating family meal time into a busy schedule, interviews with parents, educators, psychologists, doctors, chefs, and local food advocates, footage of local kids’ cooking classes, and a food event where small kids are challenged to taste things outside of their comfort zone. The film ends with a call for education and a list of resources for fun ways to get your kids involved in loving to prepare and eat healthy and delicious foods together.</p>
<p>This project is unique in the world of food films as it starts at the beginning of life and does not address weight loss. It revolves around changing societal standards to include children in adult meals, rather than separate them as hot dog eaters. Instead of dietary specifications, it offers approaches and attitudes to reduce food anxiety. It starts a conversation about alternative relationships to eating, allows for increased self-awareness, and presents an exciting opportunity to introduce children to new food. Instead of the fear and stress often associated with “getting kids to eat”, it brings inspiration to make eating enjoyable as a primary objective, emphasizing social interaction at meal times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A dark comedy from writer Garrett Kennell and director David Light, Dot focuses on a young girl with a psychotic case of OCD that leads her to kill anyone she sees making a mess.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dot is a dark comedy about a sixteen-year-old girl with an extreme case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Her case is so extreme that she compulsively kills anyone she sees making a mess. Things become more complicated when she starts to fall in love and must balance her murderous compulsion with her newly found feelings.</p>
<p>The writing and direction combination of Garrett Kennell and David Light places Dot above other short films. What separates Dot is that it’s nearly completed. However, we still have at least one more whole weekend of shooting to complete filming. We have utilized every resource we could, but we still need to finish filming and embark on a community engagement and development project. We want to ensure that the momentum for our mostly completed project continues. Without help, our ability to complete the film, spread the film, and use the experience to engage and foster creative growth in Pittsburgh all becomes compromised. Ultimately the goal is to build the film’s stature at festivals, but bring that experience back and begin showcases and discussion groups for filmmakers—especially young filmmakers—to share knowledge and ideas and encourage them to create films here in Pittsburgh. First and most importantly, however, we need to find means to finish this film.</p>]]></content:encoded>
